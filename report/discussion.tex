The confusion matrix in figure \ref{fig:confusion} is built from MFCC+HCDF Fisher Vector feature set with KNN5 classifier. We see that Classical, Metal , Blues and Jazz are the best identified genres, with accuracy exceeding 70\%, this corroborates with our visualization in figure \ref{fig:tsne1} which showed clear clustering for those genres. Genre pairs with the most confusion are \{Reggae, Hip-Hop\}, \{Rock, Disco\}, \{Rock, Country\}, which also corroborates with our visualizations in figure \ref{fig:tsne2}. 
\subsection{Classifiers and features}
It is no surprise that the best single classifier before ensemble learning is linear SVM, because our underlying features are represented in Fisher Vectors, which lends itself to efficient linear classification.
The Fisher Kernel inherits advantages from both generative and discriminative models by building a kernel from a generative model (in this case GMM),  it characterizes a sample by its deviation from the model measured by computing the gradient of the sample log-likelihood with  respect  to  the  model  parameters.\cite{HAL}.
